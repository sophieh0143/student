    "# JavaScript BankAccount Class - Required Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `BankAccount` class that returns an object. Inside this function, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Initialize Balance**:\n",
    "- Create a `balance` variable and initialize it to `100`, or any balance you want (representing $100).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Methods**:\n",
    "- `deposit(amount)`: Adds a specified amount to the balance.\n",
    "- `withdraw(amount)`: Deducts a specified amount from the balance, but only if there is enough balance.\n",
    "- `getBalance()`: Returns the current balance.\n",
    "- `transfer(amount, targetAccount)`: Transfers a specified amount from this account to another account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "- Only allow access to the `balance` variable through the `deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`, and `transfer` methods.\n",
    "- Make sure to avoid direct access to `balance` from outside the `BankAccount` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Validation**:\n",
    "- A deposit can only add positive amounts.\n",
    "- A withdrawal can only occur if the account has enough balance.\n",
    "- Transfers should be allowed only if both accounts have sufficient balance to complete the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Testing**:\n",
    "- Create a new `BankAccount` instance with a starting balance.\n",
    "- Call each method (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`, `transfer`) to verify functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "- Create a subclass of `BankAccount`, called `PremiumBankAccount`, which offers additional benefits like no transaction fees or higher transfer limits, or whatever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create two BankAccount instances**:\n",
    "   - Account 1 has an initial balance of $500.\n",
    "   - Account 2 has an initial balance of $1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test the following:**\n",
    "   - Deposit $200 into Account 1.\n",
    "   - Withdraw $50 from Account 1.\n",
    "   - Transfer $100 from Account 2 to Account 1.\n",
    "   - Print the balances of both accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to implement the `transfer` method so that it checks if both accounts have enough balance before transferring money.\n",
