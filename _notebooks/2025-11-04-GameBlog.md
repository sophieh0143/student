# Game Blog
## Have I Changed?
In the beginning of this trimester, I came into this class very, very stressed. I have worked with some light coding in the past, but it has always frusterated me. 

I hate not knowing how things work, and I get stressed because of that. But latley, in this class, I have learned to deal with stress in a healthy way! If you show up to class, that isn't learning. If you actually give yourself difficult things to solve, albeit some hard things, you can actually learn. 

When you code, it is a lot of trial and error. You code something, then test it. It fails, you go back to troubleshooting. This can be a long, grueling process, but when something works? That feeling is incredible. You can feel so accomplished, and so proud.

An example of one of these moments was when we completed one of our first assignments in this class: About Me blog.

I struggled until the late hours of the night until I completed it. When I finally deployed it on my student repo, I felt so accomplished and happy seeing my final project work.

In this class I have been VERY stressed, but in the long run it was worth the things I learned. 

#### So in short, yes; I think I have changed a lot.
